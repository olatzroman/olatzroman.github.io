##### **Children and Relationship Quality** 
with Belén Rodríguez Moro 

*How does having a child affect couples' relationship quality?* 

We examine the impact of having a child on couples' relationship quality (RQ), defined as the non-pecuniary gains from being in a relationship. Adopting a pseudo-experimental approach, we perform an event study analysis around first child birth and find a sharp and persistent decrease in RQ for both fathers and mothers immediately after birth. Individuals ranking in the 90th percentile of RQ before child birth are pushed down to the median. We attribute this effect primarily to changes in time use. First, a decrease in time spent together as a couple can explain half of the decrease in RQ. Second, we document a substantial increase in unpaid housework absorbed by women. We uncover heterogeneity in the impact of first child birth on RQ based on the division of work before birth, with women experiencing larger increases in unpaid housework also suffering a larger decrease in RQ after first child birth.

*Does city size influence the type of couples that are formed?*

In this project, we exploit geographical differences in marriage markets to unveil the main determinants of relationship quality as well as couple formation and dissolution. Using data for the United Kingdom, we show that big cities are characterized by a larger proportion of singles and by a lower stability of newly formed couples as compared to small cities. However, we also find that the risk of couple dissolution decreases faster in bigger cities and that the relationship quality of couples deteriorates at a slower pace. We then build a dynamic quantitative model of couple formation and dissolution that allows us to account for the endogeneity of location decisions and to quantify the importance of each mechanism in resulting relationship quality.
