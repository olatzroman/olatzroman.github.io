**Welcome to my website!**

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) and a member of the [Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224](https://www.crctr224.de/) "Economic Perspectives on Societal Challenges: Equality of Opportunity, Market Regulation, and Financial Stability". I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the European University Institute in 2025.

My research interests are mainly in family, labor and gender economics. I study how gendered behaviors and geographical factors influence labor market and family decisions of individuals and couples. 

You can find my [CV](https://olatzroman.github.io/assets/pdf/CVOlatzRoman.pdf) here and learn more about my [research](https://olatzroman.github.io/research/) here.
