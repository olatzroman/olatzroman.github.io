Welcome to my website!

I am a fourth year PhD student in Economics at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics) in Florence. My supervisors are [Thomas F. Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/) and [David K. Levine](http://www.dklevine.com/). 

My research interests are in family, gender and urban economics.
