**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics) in Florence. My supervisors are [Thomas F. Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/) and [Alexander Monge-Naranjo](https://alexandermonge.com/).  
I visited UC Berkeley during spring 2022.

My research interests are mainly in labor and gender economics. I study the evolution of gender gaps in the labor market and within households over time, and examine their implications on couples' decision-making.

You can find my [CV](https://olatzroman.github.io/assets/pdf/CVOlatzRoman.pdf) here and learn more about my [research](https://olatzroman.github.io/research/) here.
