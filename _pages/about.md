**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics) in Florence. My supervisors are [Thomas F. Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/) and [David K. Levine](http://www.dklevine.com/). 

I am an applied microeconomist, working in the intersection between family and urban economics, with special focus on gender.
