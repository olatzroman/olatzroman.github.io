**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics) in Florence. My supervisors are [Thomas F. Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/) and [Alexander Monge-Naranjo](https://alexandermonge.com/). 

My research interests are mainly in labor and family economics, with special focus on gender.
