**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics) in Florence. My supervisors are [Thomas F. Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/) and [Alexander Monge-Naranjo](https://alexandermonge.com/).  I visited UC Berkeley during spring 2022.

My research interests are mainly in family, labor and gender economics. I study how gendered behaviors and geographical factors influence labor market and family decisions of individuals and couples. In my [**job market paper**](https://olatzroman.github.io/assets/pdf/OlatzRoman_JMP.pdf), I analyze how first child birth impacts couples' relationship quality, revealing a substantial decline attributed to shifts in household specialization along traditional gender lines.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**

You can find my [CV](https://olatzroman.github.io/assets/pdf/CVOlatzRoman.pdf) here and learn more about my [research](https://olatzroman.github.io/research/) here.
