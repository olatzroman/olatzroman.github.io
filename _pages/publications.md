# Work in Progress

## Children and Relationship Quality
*Joint with Belen Rodríguez Moro*
We study the impact of having a child on the relationship quality of couples. We adopt a pseudo-experimental approach and carry out an event study analysis around first child birth. There is a sharp and permanent decrease in RQ immediately after birth, both for fathers and mothers. Illustratively, individuals ranking in the 90th percentile of RQ before having a child are pushed down to the median after birth.  This effect is induced by a reduction in the amount of time spent together and by an increase and reallocation of housework, which disproportionately increases women's burden. Preliminary evidence on the UK Shared Parental Leave suggests that policies encouraging egalitarian distributions of housework can mitigate the negative impact of childbirth on relationship quality.

## Until the City Do Us Part
*Joint with [Ana Moreno-Maldonado](https://sites.google.com/view/ana-moreno-maldonado/main?authuser=0) and Belen Rodríguez Moro*
In this project, we exploit geographical differences in marriage markets to unveil the main determinants of relationship quality as well as couple formation and dissolution. Using data for the United Kingdom, we show that big cities are characterized by a larger proportion of singles and by a lower stability of newly formed couples as compared to small cities. However, we also find that the risk of couple dissolution decreases faster in bigger cities and that the relationship quality of couples deteriorates at a slower pace. We then build a dynamic quantitative model of couple formation and dissolution that allows us to account for the endogeneity of location decisions and to quantify the importance of each mechanism in resulting relationship quality.
